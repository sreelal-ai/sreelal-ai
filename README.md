<h1>For My Nimmu ❤️</h1>

<div class="card">
At 2:57 AM, 2nd December 2023,  
the universe accidentally gave me my favorite human.
</div>

<div class="card">
You always want to talk to me,  
and the truth is – I wait for those talks more than anything.
</div>

<div class="card">
Your words live in “Rithu”,  
but my heart lives in you.
</div>

<div class="card">
Being with you feels less like love  
and more like finally finding my place.
</div>
