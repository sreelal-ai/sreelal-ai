<h2>My Letter</h2>

<p>
I don’t know when you became home.  
One day you were just a person,  
and suddenly you were the reason  
I check my phone and smile.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being you.  
For your patience, your madness,  
and the way you make ordinary days feel special.
</p>

<p>
Love,  
Your slightly crazy partner
